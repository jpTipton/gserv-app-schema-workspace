This data dump includes all of the data needed to recreate this workspace. I was using PostgreSQL 9.1 but it shouldn't matter. Make sure to have PostGIS installed

Requirements: 

PostgreSQL
PostGIS


Install Steps:

1) Open a terminal (cmd)
2) Locate your PostgreSQL directory and find the bin\ folder. Mine was here: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin\ . It will be in the same directory as your pgAdmin3.exe. Either:
	A) Add this path to the Environmental Variables path (Also Close and reopen terminal)
	B) cd C:\Path\to\PostgreSQL\x.x\bin\	(ex: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin\)

3)Type in terminal: psql -U postgres -d postgis -f C:\path\to\pg.sql
	-U = username
	-d = dbname	(use postgis or it won't work with app-schema definitions)
	-f = path to sql dump file
